// This file does two things:
//
// 1. Compile the AssemblyScript contract using the scripts in package.json
//    (see buildCmd below). This will create a wasm file in the 'build' folder.
// 2. Create a symbolic link (symlink) to the generated wasm file in the root
//    project's `out` folder, for easy use with near-cli.
//
// First, import some helper libraries. `shelljs` is included in the
// devDependencies of the root project, which is why it's available here. It
// makes it easy to use *NIX-style scripting (which works on Linux distros,
// macOS, and Unix systems) on Windows as well.
const sh = require('shelljs')

// Figure out which directory the user called this script from, which we'll use
// later to set up the symlink.
const calledFromDir = sh.pwd().toString()

// For the duration of this script, we want to operate from within the
// AssemblyScript project's folder. Let's change into that directory.
sh.cd(__dirname)

// You can call this script with `node compile.js` or `node compile.js --debug`.
// Let's set a variable to track whether `--debug` was used.
const debug = process.argv.pop() === '--debug'

// Use the correct build command based on the `--debug` flag
const buildCmd = debug
  ? 'npm run build:debug'
  : 'npm run build'

// Execute the build command, storing exit code for later use
const { code } = sh.exec(buildCmd)

// Assuming this is compiled from the root project directory, link the compiled
// contract to the `out` folder â€“
// When running commands like `near deploy`, near-cli looks for a contract at
// <CURRENT_DIRECTORY>/out/main.wasm

console.log(` calledFromDir: ${calledFromDir}`)
console.log(` _dirname: ${__dirname}`)

if (code === 0 && calledFromDir !== __dirname) {
  const linkDir = `${calledFromDir}/out`
  console.log(`linkDir: ${linkDir}`)
  const link = `${calledFromDir}/out/main.wasm`
